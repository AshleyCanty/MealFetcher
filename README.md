A simple take home project that fetches data from the MealDB API and presents it in a table view. The home screen shows a list of dessert items and details screen shows the recipe instructions and ingredients list after the user selects a dessert. Regex is used to parse for ingredient names and amounts so that they can be shown in the details screen.
